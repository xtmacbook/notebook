  the specular highlights after texturing. This technique, called the secondary specular color, can be manually applied or automatically 
  calculated by the lighting model. Usually, you do this using the normal OpenGL lighting model and simply turn it on using glLightModeli, 
  as shown here:
    第一种方式:
    glLightModeli(GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL, GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR);
    You can switch back to the normal lighting model by specifying GL_SINGLE_COLOR for the light model parameter:
    glLightModeli(GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL, GL_COLOR_SINGLE);
    第二种方式:
    You can also directly specify a secondary color after texturing when you are not using lighting (lighting is disabled) using the
 glSecondaryColor function. This function comes in many variations just as glColor does and is fully documented in the reference section.
 You should also note that if you specify a secondary color, you must also explicitly enable the use of the secondary color by enabling 
 the GL_COLOR_SUM flag:glEnable(GL_COLOR_SUM);
  
  secondary color 介绍:
      The GL stores both a primary four-valued RGBA color and a secondary four-valued RGBA color (where alpha is always set to 0.0) that 
      is associated with every vertex. 
      The secondary color is interpolated and applied to each fragment during rasterization when GL_COLOR_SUM is enabled。
      When lighting is enabled, and GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR is specified, the value of the secondary color is assigned the value 
      computed from the specular term of the lighting computation. Both the primary and secondary current colors are applied to each 
      fragment, regardless of the state of GL_COLOR_SUM, under such conditions. 
      
      如果设置了GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR,则无论是否设置了GL_COLOR_SUM，都会启动secondary color。如果没有开启光照但要使用后赋予specular光照
      必须单独设置GL_COLOR_SUM（是把specular color加到设置文理后的模型上而不是相乘 ：至于为什么可以参考opengl superbible中的:Texture Mapping in OpenGL: Beyond the Basics
