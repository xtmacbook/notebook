HLSL与Shader model关系:
HLSL shaders can be compiled at author-time or at runtime, and set at runtime into the appropriate pipeline stage. 
Direct3D 9 shaders can be designed using shader model 1, shader model 2 and shader model 3; Direct3D 10 shaders can 
only be designed on shader model 4. Direct3D 11 shaders can be designed on shader model 5. Direct3D 11.3 and Direct3D 12 can 
be designed on shader model 5.1, and Direct3D 12 can also be designed on shader model 6.
