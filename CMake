ADD_SUBDIRECTORY:命令的作用是为构建添加一个子路径。source_dir选项指定了CMakeLists.txt源文件和代码文件的位置，相当于索引到子CmakeLists.txt

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES: Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to search for include files. These directories are added to 
                      the directory property INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES for the current CMakeLists file. They are also added to the target 
                      property INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES for each target in the current CMakeLists file. The target property values are 
                      the ones used by the generators
